=== Configure Tomcat to use digested passwords

1.  First we need to enable digest passwords support in Tomcat by
modifying a couple of Tomcat Realms in the `server.xml` file in the
Tomcat `conf/` directory.
2.  Create a SHA encrypted version of your password.
3.  Update `tomcat-users.xml`.
4.  Verify digest passwords have been successfully enabled in Tomcat.

==== Troubleshooting

* Check the XML syntax in `tomcat-users.xml` and `server.xml` to make
sure it is well-formed and without error.
* Did you restart Tomcat after you made your changes to
`tomcat-users.xml` and `server.xml` ?
* Any errors will be reported in the `catalina.out` file in the Tomcat
`logs/` directory.
* You do not need to type the encrypted version of your password into
the browser (the browser auto-magically encrypts your password for you
before it transmits it to the server).
