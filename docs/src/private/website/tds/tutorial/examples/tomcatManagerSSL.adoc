== Enabling SSL for the Tomcat `manager` application

1.  Modify the deployment descriptor of the Tomcat `manager`
application.
2.  Verify SSL has been enabled for the Tomcat `manager` application.
3.  NOTE: You will have to redo this every time you upgrade Tomcat.

== Troubleshooting

* Check the XML syntax in `web.xml` to make sure it is well-formed and
without error.
* Did you specify a `<transport-guarantee>` of `CONFIDENTIAL`?
* Did you restart Tomcat after you made your changes to `web.xml`?
