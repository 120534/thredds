= More on the TDS Configuration File

== TDS Configuration File

=== The Basics

* Name and location:
** `content/thredds/threddsConfig.xml`
* Information describing the server
* Controlling HTML page appearance (CSS, etc.)
* Adding additional root catalogs

=== Configuring the Services Available with TDS

The TDS supports a number of services some enable by default, others
requiring some configuration before they are available.

* <<../reference/Services#serverInfo,Server Information
Services>>
* <<../reference/Services#catalogServices,Catalog Services>>
* <<../reference/Services#metadataServices,Metadata Services>>
* link:../reference/Services#dataAccessServices[Data Access
Services]

Letâ€™s try it out. A quick <<AddingServices#,exercise>>.

=== Writing netCDF-4 files

As of TDS 4.3.8, some data access services can return the requested data
written to a netCDF-4 file. This capability depends on the netCDF-C
library and requires configuring the TDS with information about the
location of the netCDF-C library. This configuration is done in the
`threddsConfig.xml` file and is described
<<../reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile#netcdfCLibrary,here>>.

=== Configuration of Caching

* <<../reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile#Cache_Locations,Disk and
Temporary File Caches>>
** CDM Disk Cache
** Aggregation Cache
** FeatureCollection Cache
** <<../reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile#GribIndexWriting,GRIB
Index Writing>>
* Object Caching
** <<../reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile#Cache_Locations,NetcdfFile
and File Handle Caching>> (covered later by John)
** <<../reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile#CatalogCaching,Static
Catalog Caching>>

=== CDM/TDS Plug-ins

* <<../reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile#runtime,CDM Runtime
Loading of Plug-ins>>
* <<../reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile#DatasetSource,Adding
DatasetSource Implementations>>
* Adding Dataset Viewer Links in HTML pages (covered later by John). +
Various methods are described <<../reference/Viewers#,here>>
including <<../reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile#Viewers,one>> that
involves changes to the `threddsConfig.xml` file.
