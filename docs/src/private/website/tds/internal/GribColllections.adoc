== Type of Partitions

=== partition = none

* read in all files at once. limited by memory (400 bytes / record ??)
* create a seperate GC for each runtime. call it a single runtime
collection SRC. All variables are in the SRC.
* if multiple runtimes, create a collection index. call it a time
partition of SRC, or TPofSRC. So, we can look at the runtime and choose
which SRC is needed.

=== partition = directory

* for each directory, create one index
* may be a SRC or a MRC
* if there are multiple directories, assume that its time partitioned
** yes: then we have a TPofSRC or TPofMRC (shouldnt matter which). above
that we get TPofTP
* this is the default, if no partition is specified in config

=== partition = file

* for each file, create one index
* may be a SRC or a MRC
* if there are multiple files, should we assume that its time
partitioned ??
** yes: then we have a TPofSRC or TPofMRC (shouldnt matter which). above
that we get TPofTP
** no: union of GC? just keep seperate time partition for each
variable??

== Types of Grib Collections

* SRC, single runtime collection (formerly GC)
* MRC, multiple runtime collection.
* TPofSRC, time partition of single runtime collection (formerly PofGC)
* TPofMRC, time partition of multiple runtime collection
* TPofTP, time partition of time partition

== Dark corners

* is the runtime accurate, eg do we know for sure for each record, or
could a vertical have different runtime if theres missing

== Homogeneity

* single Customizer(center, subcenter, master, local, genProcessId) for
each GC
* center, subcenter, master, local, genProcessType, genProcessId,
backProcessId copied from one partition (canonical). Just info I think
* horizCoordSystem (GDS)

== Issues

* is the runtime accurate, eg do we know for sure for each record, or
could a vertical have different runtime if theres missing. see
GribPartitionBuilder.makeMissing()
* partitions sorted by name. should be by date.

{collection} -> {runTime} -> {Group} : a GC is a single runtime with
1 or more groups (GDS).

PofGC = {GC}

PofP = {PofGC}

=== Case 1: {collection} has single runtime.

* config: name = collone, partition = none, topdir=c:/tmp/mixed
* index name = <config>-topdir

==== Case 2: {collection} has multiple runtime.

* config name = coll2, partition=none, topdir=c:/tmp/gfsmrt
* PofGC GC names = <config>-<topdir>-<yyyyMMdd-hhmmss>.ncx2
* PofGC index name = <config>-<topdir>
