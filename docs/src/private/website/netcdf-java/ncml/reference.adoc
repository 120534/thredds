== Variables that get aggregated

* **union**: none, all variables from all datests are simply logically
placed in the result dataset
* *joinExisting:* all variables that have the aggregation dimension as
the outer dimension
* **joinNew**: only variables explicitly specified in a *_variableAgg_*
element
* **tiled**:
* **forecastModelRunCollection, forecastModelRunCollectionSingle**: any
variable that has a grid coordinate system, ie is recognized as a Grid
by the CDM. Exclude coordinate axes, unless explicitly speced in
<variableAgg>

== Reading Files to get Initial State

* **union**: must read each file
* **joinExisting**: read one file as prototype, read time coordinate
variable of each file.
* **joinNew, joinExistingOne**: read one file as prototype, assign time
coordinate variable for each file with a filename matcher
* **tiled**: read one file as prototype, assign sections for each file
manually in NcML
* **forecastModelRunCollection**:
* **forecastModelRunCollectionSingle**:

== State

* *All:* List<Dataset>
* **union**: List<Variable>
* **outerDimension**: coord(n), List<aggVariableNames>,
* **joinExisting**:
* **joinNew, joinExistingOne**:
* **tiled**:
* **forecastModelRunCollection**:
* **forecastModelRunCollectionSingle**:

== Caching

* *joinExisting only*
* *Aggregation.setPersistenceCache(DiskCache2 dc)* must be called by the
application.
* *ToolsUI puts it in \{user.home}/.unidata/cachePersist* +
