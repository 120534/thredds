== Short guide to writing files using CF-1.6 Discrete Sampling Features Conventions

=== Step 1: Requirements

* At minimum, you must have a (lat, lon) location and a date / time
coordinate for all your data. Some types also require a vertical
coordinate (e.g. altitude, depth).

=== Step 2: Which feature type?

What kind of data do you have:

1.  **Point (unconnected) data**: data is located at different,
unconnected locations. *_Examples:_* _earthquake data, lightning
data._
2.  **Time series (station) data**: data is located at named locations,
called __stations__. There can be many stations, and usually for each
station you have multiple data with different time coordinates. Stations
have a unique identifier. *Examples*: _weather station data, fixed buoys._
3.  **Profile data**: A series of connected observations along a
vertical line. Each profile has only one lat, lon coordinate (possibly
nominal), so that the points along the profile differ only in z
coordinate and possibly time coordinate. There can be multiple profiles
in the same file, and each profile has a unique identifier If you have
many profiles with the same lat, lon location, use the Time series
Profile type. *Examples*: _atmospheric profiles from satellites, moving profilers_.
4.  **Time series (station) profile data**: Profile data at fixed
locations. This is a combination of Time series type and Profile type,
so one has time series of profiles at fixed locations. A file can
contain many stations and many time series at each station. *Examples*: _profilers, balloon soundings_.
5.  **Trajectory data**: A series of _connected_ observations along a 1D
curve in time and space. There can be multiple trajectories in the same
file, each with a unique identifier. *Examples*: _aircraft data, drifting buoys_.
6.  **Trajectory of Profiles**:  a collection of profile features
which originate along a trajectory. So these are trajectories which have
profile data (varying with z) at each (lat, lon) location. *Examples*: _ship soundings._

=== Step 3: Which representation should I use?

.  **Point (unconnected) data**: use CF {cf}[H.1]
.  **Time series (station) data**:
..  You will put only one station in the file: you may use  CF {cf}[H.2.3]
..  All stations have the exact same time coordinates: you may use  CF {cf}[H.2.1]
..  Each station has almost the same number of time coordinates and the
values may be different: you may use  CF {cf}[H.2.2]
..  Each station has different number of coordinates and you want to
keep file size as small as possible:
...  you have all the data already, and you want to optimize reading all
the data for one station: you may use CF {cf}[H.2.4]
...  you want to write the data as it arrives, in any order: you may use CF {cf}[H.2.5]
.  **Profile data**:
..  You will put only one profile in the file: you may use CF {cf}[H.3.3]
..  All profiles have the exact same vertical coordinates: you may use CF {cf}[H.3.1]
..  Each profile has almost the same number of vertical coordinates and
the values may be different: you may use  CF {cf}[H.3.2]
..  Each profile has a different number of vertical coordinates and you
want to keep file size as small as possible:
...  you have all the data already, and you want to optimize reading all
the data for one profile: you may use CF {cf}[H.3.4]
...  you want to write the data as it arrives, in any order: you may use CF {cf}[H.3.5]
.  **Time series (station) Profile data**:
..  You will put only one station in the file: you may use  CF {cf}[H.5.2]
..  Each station has the same number of profiles, and the same number of
vertical levels for each profile : you may use  CF {cf}[H.5.1]
..  Each station has a different number of profiles and/or the level
coordinates for each station may vary : you may use  CF {cf}[H.5.3]
.  **Trajectory data**:
..  You will put only one trajectory in the file: you may use  CF {cf}[H.4.2]
..  All trajectories have the same or almost the same number of points:
you may use  CF {cf}[H.4.1]
..  Each trajectory has different number of points and you want to keep
file size as small as possible:
...  you have all the data already, and you want to optimize reading all
the data for one trajectory: you may use CF {cf}[H.4.3]
...  you want to write the data as it arrives, in any order: you may use CF {cf}[H.4.4]
.  **Trajectory of Profiles**:  
..  You will put only one trajectory in the file: you may use  CF {cf}[H.6.2]
..  All trajectories have the same or almost the same number of points:
you may use  CF {cf}[H.6.1]
..  Each trajectory has different number of profiles and/or vertical
coordinates: you may use CF {cf}[H.6.3]

=== Step 4: Test a sample file

.  Write a test file with some sample data in it.
.  Test in ToolsUI (https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/webstart/netCDFtools.jnlp[webstart link])
..  Go to Feature Types / Point Features Tab
..  On the right is a combobox with the feature type choices. Select the correct type (or leave ANY_POINT to let the CDM figure it out).
..  Enter the file name or navigate with the FileChooser image:../../images/filechooser.png[image]
..  If it works, the various tables will be filled in - click on a table row to navigate the feature heirarchy. The context menu (right-click) on
the large table lets you show the data.
..  This widget is pretty clumsy (sorry - we will improve as soon as the MacArthur money arrives).
For point data you have to click the _Get ALL Data_ button image:../../images/getall.png[image] above the right navigation pane.
..  This essentially tests the CDM ability to read your file.
The CDM is a bit more lenient than CF in some ways, and a bit more restrictive in others (see below for details).
.  The http://cfconventions.org/compliance-checker.html[CF compliance checkers] may also help diagnose issues.

=== Miscellaneous questions and advice

1.  *Should I use the unlimited dimension?* This can have a huge
impact on performance for large files, because it affects the data
layout on disk. The answer is: it depends.
* If you have lots of variables at each observation, and you want to
optimize the case of getting one or a few variables at all the points,
then *don’t* use the unlimited dimension. This is called __column
oriented storage__.
* If you want to optimize the case of getting all or most of the
variables at each point, then use the unlimited dimension. This is
called __row oriented storage__.
* For important, long-lived archives, you should test the performance of
each case using the read access pattern that you want to optimize.
* If you don’t know, then my prejudice is to use the unlimited
dimension. For small datasets (<10 M ?) it is probably not that
important.
2.  *Should I use coordinate variables or auxiliary coordinate variables?*
* A coordinate variable is 1D, and has the same name as its dimension,
e.g. _*float time(time).*_ The coordinate values must be monotonically
increasing or decreasing. There can be no missing values. Use a
coordinate variable if those conditions are true.
* An auxiliary coordinate variable may have missing values, and is not
required to have monotonic, or even unique values. If that’s the
situation, you must use an auxiliary coordinate, e.g. _*float
time(sample).*_
3.  *What’s the reason to include ids for things like trajectories or profiles?*
* The instance ids allow software like the CDM to efficiently fetch just the data for a named feature, using the id.
4.  *How big should I make my files? How should I divide the data between files?*
* If you have the choice, a fewer number of large files is better than zillions of small files.
I would shoot for files in the range 50M - 2 Gbytes.
* More important is to divide your files into distinct time ranges,
called __time partitioned files__. This is a natural way to divide earth
science data. It allows the CDM to serve many files as a single dataset
using __CDM feature collections__. For time partitioned files, if
possible, put the partitioning date in the filename.
5.  *Why should I bother to do all this extra work?*
* If you are publicly funded, you should make your data as accessible to others as possible.
This is the minimum extra work your peers think is needed for them to be able to use your data.
And they sincerely thank you!

 

== Differences from CF

=== 9.1 Limits on coordinate types

Horizontal coordinates:

* CF: _In Table 9.1 the spatial coordinates x and y typically refer to
longitude and latitude but other horizontal coordinates could also be
used (see sections 4 and 5.6)_
* CDM: only latitude and longitude are supported.

Vertical coordinates:

* CDM: vertical coordinate may be height or pressure. Dimensionless
Vertical Coordinates are not supported.

=== 9.3 Limits on dimension ordering

* CF: _In the multidimensional array representations, data variables
have both an instance dimension and an element dimension.  The
dimensions may be given in any order_.
* CDM: the instance dimension must be the outer (slowest varying)
dimension

=== 9.4 Attribute featureType is required

* CF: _A global attribute, **featureType**, is required for all Discrete
Geometry representations except the orthogonal multidimensional array
representation, for which it is highly recommended_.
* CDM: The global attribute **featureType** is always required.
Acceptable aliases are *CF:featureType* and *CF:feature_type* .

=== 9.5  Feature instance id variable is required

* CF: _Where feasible a variable with the attribute **cf_role** should
be included.  The only acceptable values of cf_role for Discrete
Geometry CF data sets are timeseries_id, profile_id, and trajectory_id.
  The variable carrying the cf_role attribute may have any data type.
 When a variable is assigned this attribute, it must provide a unique
identifier for each feature instance._
* CDM: A variable representing the instance id is *required*, indicated by
an attribute named  **cf_role**, which follows all the CF rules above.

== Notes on representations

In all cases, latitude, longitude, altitude and time coordinates must be
recognized in the usual CF way. The altitude coordinate is optional in
some of the forms.

also see:

* <<CFencodingTable#,DSG Encoding Table>>
* <<DSGtableNotation#,CDM table notation for DSG>>

=== H.1 Point Data

In the CDM, point data is recognized by the _featureType = point_
global attribute. The altitude coordinate is optional. All coordinates
must have the same dimension, called the _obs_ or _sample_ dimension.
All variables with the obs dimension as outer dimension are data
variables.

=== H.2 Time Series Data

In the CDM, this form is recognized by the _featureType = timeSeries_ global attribute. The altitude coordinate is optional.

Special station variables are recognized by standard names as given below. For backwards compatibility, the given aliases are allowed.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|======================
|standard_name |alias
a|
timeseries_id

 a|
station_id

a|
platform_name

 a|
station_description

a|
surface_altitude

 a|
station_altitude

a|
platform_id

 a|
station_WMO_id

|======================

=== H.2.1 / H.2.2 Multidimensional Time Series Representation

The lat, lon and altitude coordinates must have the same dimension,
called the _station_ or _instance_ dimension. All variables with the
station dimension as outer dimension are __station variables__. The time
dimension must be of the form *time(time)* or **time(station, time)**,
where the time dimension is the _obs_ or _sample_ dimension. All data
variables must have the form **data(station, time)**.

For compatibility with earlier versions

* *ragged_row_count* is an alias for *sample_dimension* standard name
* *ragged_row_index* is an alias for *feature_dimension* standard name
* all attributes can optionally be prefixed by CF:

=== H.2.3. Single time series, including deviations from a nominal fixed
spatial location

The CDM uses the axis attribute to choose the correct coordinate.
However, it provides no special handling for the precise coordinates.

=== H.2.4. Contiguous ragged array representation of time series

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=====================
|standard |alias
a|
sample_dimension

 a|
CF:ragged_row_count

a|
instance_dimension

 a|
CF:ragged_parent_index
|=====================

=== H.3.5. Indexed ragged array representation of profiles

Example only shows _double time(profile)_ but _double time(obs)_ is also possible, when the observation varies by time.

=== H.5.1. Multidimensional array representations of time series profiles

The CF specification says _The pressure(i,p,o), temperature(i,p,o), and
humidity(i,p,o) data for element o of profile p at station i are
associated with the coordinate values time(i,p), z(i,p,o), lat(i), and
lon(i). Any of the three dimensions could be the netCDF unlimited
dimension, if it might be useful to be able enlarge it_.

Since CDM currently only allows dimensions to be in the order (station,
profile, z), then only the station dimension could be unlimited in the
multidimensional representation.
