CDM Remote is a web service implemented in the CDM library (client) and TDS (server), providing remote access to CDM datasets, using
<<NcStream#,ncstream>> as the on-the-wire protocol. An experimental python client is under development.
It provides access at the NetcdfFile and FeatureDataset levels of the CDM API, so there are two levels of services:

.  *<<CdmRemote#,CDM Remote>>* provides index subsetting on remote CDM datasets, with the same functionality that *NetcdfFile* provides for
CDM local datasets and *DODSNetcdfFile* provides for remote OPeNDAP datasets. CdmRemote supports the full CDM data model.
.  *CDM Remote Feature* provides coordinate subsetting on remote CDM Feature Datasets, with similar functionality to OGC's
*Web Coverage Service* and the exact functionality of Unidata's *<<{tdsDocs}/NetcdfSubsetServiceReference,NetCDF Subset Service>>* (NCSS).
..  <<CdmrFeatureGrid#,CDM Remote Feature for Coverage/Grid Data>> provides coordinate subsetting on remote CDM Coverage (Grid) Feature Datasets
..  <<CdmrFeaturePoint#,CDM Remote Feature for Point Data>> provides coordinate subsetting on remote CDM Point (DSG) Feature Datasets

This API and protocol is available in TDS/CDM version >= 5.0.
