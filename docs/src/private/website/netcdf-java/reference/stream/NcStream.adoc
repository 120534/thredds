= NetCDF Streaming Format

== Overview

NetCDF Streaming Format (*ncstream*) is a write-optimized encoding of CDM datasets. Ncstream consists of a series of header and data messages, in any
order. Writes are always appended. Later messages override earlier ones whenever they overlap or conflict. To add or modify structural metadata,
simply append a new header message. Each data message identifies the variable and the section (rectangular subset) of data it contains. A variable's
data thus consists of the collection of data messages for it, if any.

Ncstream implements the full <<../../CDM/index#,CDM data model.>>

=== Design Goals

* Experiment with our own on-the-wire protocol to rapidly explore new ideas for remote data access.
* Experiment with ways to optimize subset extraction of large datasets, especially for the case when the subset is specified in coordinate space
rather than index space.
* Must be easy to read ncstream and write netCDF-3 or netCDF-4 files.
* The information content / data model of ncstream is identical to CDM. So ncstream is an alternate encoding of CDM datasets.

=== Possible uses

* Study OPeNDAP implementation. The java implementation of ncstream should be (close to) maximal I/O efficient. By comparing the same requests on the
same server to OPeNDAP, we should be able to tell how much speedup a rewrite of the OPeNDAP software will yield.
* Augment/explore OPeNDAP. Where the DAP protocol is deficient, ncstream is a way for us to explore possible solutions.
* Augment/explore WCS. We are setting up experimental data services on thredds.ucar.edu that allow coordinate subsetting on Feature datasets. We can
use ncstream to get these services working, offering much the same functionality as WCS. Implementing WCS services are then much easier to develop.
Experience using ncstream can potentially be fed into WCS standards. This work has already been going on under the name of "NetCDF Subset Service",
and ncstream will be offered as one of the output types.
* Explore asynchronous data services. Both OPeNDAP and WCS want asynchronous data services, for the case when requested data cannot be immediately
returned, for example because of extensive computation or because the data resides in a tape silo. We can explore possible solutions by having our own
remote access protocol.
* Explore alternate file format for CDM datasets. Certain applications may need some of the extended features of CDM / Netcdf-4, without needing all
of the complexity of the HDF5 format. Ncstream may comprise a "sweet spot" of functionality for some use cases.
* Parallel I/O. Append-only file writing may be useful in some high performance applications, with a second pass (external to the generating program)
that efficiently converts to netCDF-3 or netCDF-4 files. During that conversion, a smart program could decide on chunking parameters, data-dependent
compression choices, and other read optimizations.

=== Implementation

Messages are encoded using Google's http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/[Protobuf] library.
____
Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You
define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to
and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages. You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs that
are compiled against the "old" format.
____

The main advantage of protobuf over XML is performance, since both message size and parsing speed is improved. A very important feature of protobuf is
the ability to evolve the message structure in a way that doesn't break previous code.

The protobuf messages are defined by

* *_\{repo}/cdm/src/main/java/ucar/nc2/stream/ncStream.proto_*
* *_\{repo}/cdm/src/main/java/ucar/nc2/ft2/coverage/remote/cdmrfeature.proto_*
