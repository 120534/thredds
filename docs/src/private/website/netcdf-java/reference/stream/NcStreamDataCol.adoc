= NcStream Data Column-oriented (version 2)
[[threddsDocs]]

* This documents version 2 of the NcStream Data message, used by CDM/TDS >= 5.0.
* This is the "column oriented" variant. These variants are identical except for Structures.
* Leaving out compression for now.

=== Arrays of primitive data

* For all primitive data types, specified by _dataType_, with _isVlen_= false.
* The data is laid out in row-major order in _primdata_.
* The total number of elements is _nelems_.
* The shape of the Array is specified by _section_.
* Endianness is specified by _bigend_.

=== Arrays of string

* For data type = STRING.
* The data is laid out in row-major order in _stringdata_.
* The number of elements is _nelems_.
* The shape of the Array is specified by _section_.
* String data is always UTF-8 encoded.

=== Arrays of opaque

* For data type = OPAQUE.
* The data is laid out in row-major order in _opaquedata_.
* The number of elements is _nelems_.
* The shape of the Array is specified by _section_.
* Opague data are variable length of bytes, aka blobs.

=== Vlen

Variable-length data has a *variable length dimension* in its outermost (fastest varying) dimension, so it has the form:

----
  dataType varname(d1,d2,di,*);

  where
    d1,d2,di are 0 or more fixed-length dimensions; this is the data's "fixed shape".
    * is the last, vlen dimension.
----

* For _isVlen_ = true.
* The data is laid out in row-major order in _primdata_, _stringdata_, or _opaquedata_, depending on the _dataType_.
* The total number of elements in the data array is _nelems_.
* The fixed shape of the data is specified by _section_.
* The length of each variable-length array is stored in _vlens_. There will be _shape.size()_ of them.
* The sum of the _vlens_ is equal to _nelems_.
* see <<../../CDM/VariableLengthData#,vlen data>>

Examples:

. when encoding, the length of each vlen is known, so:
.. _float vlen(*)_ will have a known length when the data is read, so this can be encoded the same as a regular array
.. _float vlen(3,7, *)_ has 21 variable length arrays, stored in the vlens array
... *primdata* has nelems * sizeof(dataType) bytes, turn into dim array of primitives, use vlens to divide into variable length arrays

=== Structures

* For data type = STRUCTURE.
* The data is stored separately for each member in _ArrayStructureDataCol_. This is called _column oriented_ storage.
* The number of rows in the Structure is _nelems_.
* The shape of the array of Structures is specified by _section_, where _section.size() == nelems_.

For each Structure Member:

* Each member has a _Data2_ message in the _ArrayStructureDataCol.memberData_.
* The member _dataType_ is arbitrary, including nested Structures.
* The member _section_ describes the shape of the entire data array, including parent Structures (see Nested Structures below).
* The data is stored exactly the same as in top-level _DataCol_ messages.

=== Nested Structures

A nested Structure like

----
Structure {
  int fld1
  string fld2(12);
  Structure {
    float fld3;
    long fld4(2,3);
  } inner(99)
} s(123)
----

can be encoded like:

----
  int s.fld1(123)
  string s.fld2(123, 12);
  float s.inner.fld3(123,99);
  long s.inner.fld4(123,99,2,3);
----

* The shape of member data includes the outer structure(s).
* All of the data resides at the innermost member.

==== Vlens inside of structures

These can only make other vlens (last dimension a vlen):

----
Structure {
  int fld1
  string fld2(*);
  Structure {
    float fld3;
    long fld4(2,*);
  } inner(99)
} s(33)
----

makes:
----
  int s(33).fld1
  string s(33).fld2(*);
  float s(33).inner(99).fld3;
  long s(33).inner(99).fld4(2,*);
----

or

----
  int s.fld1(33)
  string s.fld2(33,*);
  float s.inner.fld3(33,99);
  long s.inner.fld4(33,99,2,*);
----

so these are coded as normal vlens in the innermost Structure, with a fixed shape including any parent Structures.



== Nested sequences

An outer sequence is not a problem

----
Sequence {
  int fld1
  string fld2(12);
  Structure {
    float fld3;
    long fld4(2,3);
  } inner(99)
} seq;
----

Because when writing the data, the actual number sent over the wire will be known.

The problem comes with nested sequences:

----
Structure {
  int fld1
  string fld2(*);
  Sequence {
    float fld3;
    long fld4(2,*);
  } seq;
} s(33)
----

which gives in the innermost nested structures:

----
  int s.fld1(33)
  string s.fld2(33,*);
  float s.inner.fld3(33,*);
  long s.inner.fld4(33,*,2,*);
----

The solution is that the _vlens_ array lists variable-length array length; taking the place of (33,*), and tells the reader
how to divide up the nelems flds:

----
  int s.fld1(33)
  string s.fld2(33,*);
  float s.inner.fld3(nelems);
  long s.inner.fld4(nelems,2,*);
----

In this example _s.seq_ DataCol message has:

----
message DataCol {
  string fullName = "seq"
  DataType dataType = "SEQUENCE"
  Section section = null;
  bool isVlen = "true";
  uint32 nelems = sum of vlens

  bytes primdata = null
  repeated string = null
  repeated uint32 vlens = size: 33
  repeated bytes opaquedata = null;
  ArrayStructureCol structdata = present
}
----

Assume for this example that the sum of vlens = 6789.
The reader uses seq _s.seq.vlens_ to allocate the 6738 values into 33 variable length arrays of Structure objects.

The _s.seq.fld2_ DataCol message has:

----
message DataCol {
  string fullName = "fld2"
  DataType dataType = "FLOAT"
  Section section = "(6738)";
  bool isVlen = "false";
  uint32 nelems = "6738"

  bytes primdata = 6738 floats
  repeated string null
  repeated uint32 vlens = null
  repeated bytes opaquedata = null;
  ArrayStructureCol structdata = null
}
----

The _s.seq.fld4_ DataCol message has:

----
message DataCol {
  string fullName = "fld4"
  DataType dataType = "LONG"
  Section section = "(6738,2)";
  bool isVlen = "true";
  uint32 nelems = sum of vlens

  bytes primdata = nelems longs
  repeated string null
  repeated uint32 vlens = size: 6738*2
  repeated bytes opaquedata = null;
  ArrayStructureCol structdata = null
}
----

The reader uses seq _s.seq.fld4.vlens_ to allocate the values into 6738*2 variable length arrays of longs.
