= CDM Data Types

This document explains how CDM data types are mapped into Netcdf-Java objects for version 5.0+. An IOSP chooses
a Variable's DataType to best represent whatever the native file format uses.

== DataTypes

=== Integer Types

The CDM signed integer types are *BYTE, SHORT, INT*, and *LONG* and unsigned integer types are *UBYTE, USHORT, UINT* or *ULONG*.
Each are mapped to the corresponding Java primitive type, which are 1,2,4, and 8 bytes wide, respectively.

When the underlying file format stores data as unsigned integers, an
IOSP may decide to widen the type to a signed type, eg

* unsigned byte -> signed short
* unsigned short -> signed int
* unsigned int -> signed long

Otherwise, the variable is kept as an unsigned integer type with
type *UBYTE, USHORT, UINT* or **ULONG**. Since Java does not have
unsigned integer types, handling unsigned values requires some
attention. Unsigned integer data are stored in the corresponding signed
primitive types. You can detect this by calling _DataType.isUnsigned()_,
or simply examining the DataType.

You may use static methods in *ucar.ma2.DataType* to convert one value
at a time:

[source,java]
----
  static public long unsignedIntToLong(int i);
  static public int unsignedShortToInt(short s);
  static public short unsignedByteToShort(byte b);
----

You may use this static method in *ucar.ma2.MAMath* to widen all the values in an Array:

[source,java]
----
 public static Array convertUnsigned( Array unsigned);
----

*ArrayByte, ArrayShort* and *ArrayInt* will widen an unsigned value when
casting to wider type like float or double. For example, calling _data.getDouble()_
on an unsigned integer type will return the widened value cast to a double.

=== Floating Point Types

The CDM floating point types are *FLOAT* and *DOUBLE* . Each are mapped to the
corresponding Java primitive type.

=== Char and String Types

A *String* is a variable length array of http://unicode.org/[Unicode] characters.
When reading/writing a String to a file or other external representation, the characters are by default
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8[UTF-8 encoded] (note that ASCII is a subset of UTF-8).
Libraries may use different internal representations, for example the Java library uses UTF-16 encoding.

The *char* type is an unsigned byte containing uninterpreted characters, typically 7-bit ASCII. These are more or less
a historical accident from netCDF's Fortran77 roots, and are typically used to store string data. Internally, Netcdf-Java
uses Java's *char* primitive type which is actually 2 bytes. Because there is no encoding specified for _char_ data,
its use is discouraged, except for ASCII string data in netCDF-3.

=== Structure

A *Structure* is a type of Variable that contains other Variables, analogous to a *_struct_* in C, or a *_row_* in a relational database.
In general, the data in a Structure are physically stored close together
on disk, so that it is efficient to retrieve all of the data in a
Structure at the same time. A Variable contained in a Structure is a
**member Variable**, and can only be read in the context of its
containing Structure.

The data of a Structure is returned in a *StructureData* object.
Since a Structure may be multidimensional, *Structure.read()* returns an
*ArrayStructure,* a subclass of Array which contains an array of
StructureData objects. Alternatively, one can call
*Structure.getStructureIterator()* and iterate through the
*StructureData* in canonical order. This potentially is a very efficient
way to access the data, since the data does not have to be read into memory all at the same time.

A Structure can only have a variable length dimension if its 1D, ie its a Sequence. This is not a restriction on generality,
since one can always make:

----
Structure {
  ...
} s(123,*);
----

into

----
Structure {
  Structure {
    ...
  } inner(*);
} s(123);
----


=== Sequence

A *Sequence* is a variable length, one dimensional Structure whose length is not known until you actually read the data.
To access the data in a Sequence, you can only iterate through the StructureData records one at a time using
*Structure.getStructureIterator(),* ie you cannot call Sequence.read() or get the ith StructureData object.

=== Enumeration

An *enum* type is an mapping of integer values to Strings. The mapping
itself is stored in an *EnumTypedef* object in the **Group**, and so is
shared across all Variables that use that enumeration.

A enumeration Variable will have DataType **ENUM1**, **ENUM2**, or **ENUM4**, depending on whether the the enum value is stored in 1, 2, or 4 bytes.
The raw values are returned in a byte, short, or integer array.
One can convert these raw values to the corresponding String _enumeration values_ in a way that does not depend on their internal representation, for example:

[source,java]
----
 if (var.getDataType().isEnum()) {
    Array rawValues = var.read();
    Array enumValues = Array.factory(DataType.STRING, rawValues.getShape());
    IndexIterator ii = enumValues.getIndexIterator();

    // use implicit Array iterator
    while (rawValues.hasNext()) {
      String sval = var.lookupEnumString(rawValues.nextInt());
      ii.setObjectNext(sval);
    }
  } 
----

When wrapping a NetcdfFile with a NetcdfDataset, by default enumerations
will be converted to their String values, and the type of the Variable
will be changed to String. This conversion is controlled by the
*enhanceMode* parameter on NetcdfDataset.open:

[source,java]
----
 static public NetcdfDataset openDataset(String location, EnumSet<Enhance> enhanceMode,
    int buffer_size, CancelTask cancelTask, Object spiObject);
----

or by setting the default enhanceMode:

[source,java]
----
 static public void setDefaultEnhanceMode(EnumSet<Enhance> mode);
----

If you want to turn enum conversion off, create your own EnumSet enhanceMode, for example this leaves the other enhancements on:

[source,java]
----
 EnumSet<Enhance> myEnhanceMode = EnumSet.of(Enhance.ScaleMissing, Enhance.CoordSystems);
----

=== Opaque

An *opaque* type stores uninterpreted blobs of bytes. The length of the
blob is not known until it is read, and an array of opaque objects may
have different lengths for each of the objects. Opaque data is returned
as *java.nio.ByteBuffer* objects wrapped by an **ArrayObject**.

== Reading Data

An *Array* contains the actual data for a Variable after it is read from the disk or network.
Data access can be done through these methods (with caveats noted below):

[source,java]
----
Array data = Variable.read();
Array data = Variable.read(int[] origin, int[] shape);
Array data = Variable.read(ucar.ma2.Section section);
Array data = Variable.read(List<Range> ranges);
Array data = Variable.read(String sectionSpec);
----

Typically the data is read into memory when the _read()_ method is called,
and so all of these methods may throw an IOException.

The returned Array has the following characteristics:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|====================================================
|DataType |Array subclass |Array.getElementType
|BYTE, UBYTE, ENUM1 |ArrayByte |byte.class
|SHORT, USHORT, ENUM2 |ArrayShort |short.class
|INT, UINT, ENUM4 |ArrayInt |int.class
|LONG, ULONG |ArrayLong |long.class
|FLOAT |ArrayFloat |float.class
|DOUBLE |ArrayDouble |double.class
|CHAR |ArrayChar |char.class
|STRING |ArrayObject |String.class
|STRUCTURE |ArrayStructure |StructureData.class
|SEQUENCE |ArraySequence |StructureDataIterator.class
|OPAQUE |ArrayObject |ByteBuffer.class
|====================================================

=== Structures

For Variables that are members of a Structure, after the data has been
read into a *StructureData*, the member data may be extracted through
these methods ( where XXX are the various data types):

[source,java]
----
 Array data = StructureData.getArray( memberName);
 XXX data = StructureData.getScalarXXX( memberName);
 XXX[] data = StructureData.getJavaArrayXXX( memberName);
----

In this case, the data has already been read, so there is no
IOException.

Note that in general you should use **StructureData**.*getXXX( String
memberName)* and not **StructureData**.**getXXX( StructureData.Member
member)**.

For nested Structure and Sequences (that is, Structure members that are themselves Structures or Sequences), use

[source,java]
----
 StructureData data = StructureData.getScalarStructure( memberName);
 ArrayStructure data = StructureData.getArrayStructure( memberName);
 ArraySequence data = StructureData.getArraySequence( memberName);
----

=== Sequences

The usual _read()_ methods cannot be used on Sequences *(DataType.SEQUENCE)* ; data can only be
read through *Sequence.getStructureIterator(int bufferSize)* which returns *StructureData* objects:

[source, java]
----
StructureDataIterator sdataIter = obs.getStructureIterator(-1);
while (sdataIter.hasNext()) {
  StructureData sdata = sdataIter.next();
  ....
}
----

Sequence data thus cannot be subset, but only sequentially traversed.

=== Variable Length Data

When a Variable has a variable length dimension, *Variable.isVariableLength()* is true and things are more complicated
than with rectangular arrays. <<VariableLengthData#,Details>>.
