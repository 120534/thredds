= Variable Length Data

== Variable Length Data

=== Overview

*_Variable Length_* Variables have their outermost (fastest changing) _Dimension.isVariableLength()_ = true.
This means that the length of the dimension varies, and is not known until the data is read.
A variable length (aka _vlen_) Dimension is shown with a '*' instead of a length. Thus in CDM:

  dimensions:
    acqtime = 21;
  variables:
    float levels(acqtime, *);

indicate there are 21 float arrays of variable length.

In the HDF5/netCDF4 data model this would be expressed as:

  types:
    float(*) vlen_t;
  dimensions:
    acqtime = 21;
  variables:
    vlen_t levels(acqtime);

If the Variable has only a single vlen dimension (rank == 1), the returned data array will be a regular Array of the appropriate type.
For a Variable with a nested vlen Dimension, the returned data array will be an ArrayObject, with _isVlen() == true_, containing regular Arrays whose lengths are independent.

[source,java]
----
Array data = v.read();
if (data.isVlen()) {
  assert (data instanceof ArrayObject);
  while (data.hasNext()) {
    Object inner = data.nextObject();
    assert (inner instanceof Array);
    assert (inner instanceof ArrayFloat.D1);
  }

}  else if (data.getDataType == DataType.FLOAT) {
    assert (data instanceof ArrayFloat.D1);

}  else // etc

}
----


One can subset on normal dimensions, but not on the variable length dimension:

[source,java]
----
Array data = v.read("0:20:2,:"); // ok
Array data = v.read(":,0"); // fail
----

=== Nesting

A vlen dimension isnt really needed as the outer dimension eg:

      float upper_air(*);

Here it would be better for the IOSP to discover what the actual length is (if possible) and show it:

      float upper_air(235);

whereas

      float levels(21, *);

expresses succinctly that these are variable length arrays, and says everything that can be said about the data at the
structural metadata level, short of listing the 21 array lengths. _Nesting_ here refers to the variable length dimension being
nested inside one or more outer dimensions.

Nesting can also refer to member variables nested inside of a *_Structure_*:

  Structure {
    int count(*);
    float fld2;
    byte fld3(10);
  } obs (123);

Again here the vlen expresses that each of the 123 obs structures will have a _count_ array of different lengths,
whereas fld2 will always be scalar and fld3 will always be an array of length 10.

However, there may be legitimate uses of outermost vlen dimensions, for example if its a remote dataset and the length is
too costly to discover, or if the length is indeterminate until the data is actually read.

This is the idea of the *_Sequence_*, which is simply a rank 1 Structure of unknown length:

  Structure {
    int count(*);
    float fld2;
    byte fld3(10);
  } obs(*);

can be replaced by:

  Sequence {
    int count(*);
    float fld2;
    byte fld3(10);
  } obs;

There is a difference between the two in the API. With Structures, a user can read all the data into memory (remember one
cannot subset on a vlen, so its all or nothing):

  ArrayStructure as = structVar.read(); // all data is read into memory
  StructureData sdata = as.getStructureData(19); // get the 19th one

For a Sequence, one can only iterate through one StructureData at a time:

  StructureDataIterator iter = seqVar.getStructureIterator();
  while (iter.hasNext()) { // loop over all StructureData
      StructureData sdata = iter.next();
    ...
  }

For the price of giving up access to the ith StructureData, the StructureDataIterator can read in as few or as many into memory at a time
for efficiency. (Note that _Structure.getStructureDataIterator()_ also exists, so this optimization can be used for Structures also).

The canonical use cases for an outer Sequence is 1) the result of a database query and 2) an unlimited stream of data from a sensor network.

An inner sequence can be used instead of a vlen dimension:

  Sequence {
    Sequence {
      int count;
    } seqInner;
    float flob;
    byte drivel(10);
  } obs;

although this adds some complexity. A better use case for inner sequences is when more than one member is involved:

  Sequence {
    Sequence {
      int fld1;
      float fld2;
    } seqInner;
    float flob;
    byte drivel(10);
  } obs;

This indicates that each obs has variable length arrays for _fld1_ and _fld2_, but that every _fld1_ has an associated _fld2_, which is not the case for:

----
  Sequence {
    int fld1(*)
    float fld2(*)
    float flob;
    byte drivel(10);
  } obs;
----

The inner sequences can be retrieved like:

[source,java]
----
StructureDataIterator iter2 = seqVar.getStructureIterator();
while (iter2.hasNext()) {
  StructureData sdata = iter2.next();
  ArraySequence nested = sdata.getArraySequence("seqInner");
  System.out.printf("inner sequence size=%d%n", nested.getStructureDataCount());

  try (StructureDataIterator nestedIter = nested.getStructureDataIterator()) {
    while (nestedIter.hasNext()) {
      StructureData nestedData = nestedIter.next();
      int fld1Value = nestedData.getScalarInt("fld1");
      ...
    }
  }
  ...
}
----

== CDM ArrayObject

[source,java]
----
 Structure {
    int shutterPositionA;
    int shutterPositionB(12);
    int loopDataA(3, *);
    int loopDataB(1, *);
    int loopDataC(*);
  } record(time=29);
----

[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
| col | returns
| record(i).shutterPositionA.getArray() | ArrayInt.D0
| record(i).shutterPositionB.getArray() | ArrayInt.D1(12)
| record(i).shutterPositionA.getArray() | ArrayObject(3).ArrayInt(*)
| record(i).shutterPositionB.getArray() | ArrayObject(1).ArrayInt(*)
| record(i).shutterPositionC.getArray() | ArrayInt.D1(m)
