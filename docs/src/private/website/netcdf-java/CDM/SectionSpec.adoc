= CDM Section Specification (Fortran 90 array syntax)

CDM accepts a request for a Variable section in String form.

== Grammar

----
     section specification := selector | selector '.' selector
     selector := varName ['(' dims ')']
     varName := ESCAPED_STRING


     dims := dim | dim, dims
     dim := ':' | slice | start ':' end | start ':' end ':' stride
     slice := INTEGER
     start := INTEGER
     stride := INTEGER
     end := INTEGER
     ESCAPED_STRING : must escape characters = ".("
  
   * Nonterminals are in lower case, terminals are in upper case, literals are in single quotes.
   * Optional components are enclosed between square braces '[' and ']'.

=== Notes

If a variable name appears without (), then the request is for all of it.
