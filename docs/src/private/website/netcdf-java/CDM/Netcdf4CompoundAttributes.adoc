= NetCDF-4 Compound Attributes

== Overview

NetCDF4 / HDF5 does not support attributes on fields in Compound types.
This page defines Conventions to support attributes on individual fields in a Compound type.

=== Example

Consider an example of a compound variable in NetCDF-4, using CDL:

-------------------------------------
netcdf point.nc4 {
 types:
  compound record_t {
    double time ;
    double latitude ;
    double longitude ;
    byte data ;
    float z ;
  }
 
 dimensions:
   obs = UNLIMITED ; // (5 currently)
 
 variables:
   record_t record(obs) ;
}
-------------------------------------

We would like to add any number of attributes of arbitrary type to the
fields of this compound type. For example, suppose we want to
write the following CDM dataset to a netCDF4 file:

------------------------------------------------------
netcdf point.nc {
  dimensions:
    time= 5;

  variables:
   Structure {
    int lon;
      :long_name = "longitude";
      :units = "degrees_east";
    int lat;
      :long_name = "latitude";
      :units = "degrees_north";
    float z;
      :long_name = "height above mean sea level";
      :units = "km";
      :positive = "up";
    short time;
      :units = "days since 1970-01-01 00:00:00";
    byte data;
      :long_name = "skin temperature";
      :units = "Celsius";
      :coordinates = "time lon lat z";
      :calibration = 1382.89f, 12.0f, 0.008f; // float
   } obs(time);

}
------------------------------------------------------

=== Compound attribute Convention

The *_Compound attribute Convention_* is a convention for adding attributes to members of a compound type in a netCDF4 file.
It creates a new compound type, named "*__<typename>_field_atts_t_*" where _<typename>_ is the original type. The new type has one
field for each attribute on any of the original fields, named "*_<field>:<attname>_*", where _<field>_ is the field name in the
original type, _<attname>_ is the desired attribute name for that field, and the ":" char delineates the two.
Note that the data type of any of these attributes is arbitrary.
Note that the leading "_" of the compound type indicates that it is being used in a special way by the library.

Example in CDL:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
netcdf point.nc4 {
 types:
  compound record_t {
    double time ;
    double latitude ;
    double longitude ;
    byte data ;
    float z ;
  }; 
  compound _record_t_field_atts_t { # <1>
    string time\:units;           # <2>
    string latitude\:units;
    string latitude\:long_name ;
    string longitude\:units;
    string longitude\:long_name;
    string data\:units;
    string data\:long_name;
    string data\:coordinates;
    float data\:calibration(3) ;
    string z\:units;
    string z\:long_name;
    string z\:positive;
  }; 

dimensions:
  obs = UNLIMITED ; // (5 currently)

variables:
  record_t record(obs) ;
    _record_t_field_atts_t record:_field_atts = # <3>
     {{"days since 1970-01-01 00:00:00"}, 
     {"degrees_north"}, {"station latitude"}, 
     {"degrees_east"}, {"station longitude"}, 
     {"Celsius"}, {"skin temperature"}, {"time lon lat z"}, { 1382.89f, 12.0f, 0.008f}
     {"km"}, {"height above mean sea level"}, {"up"}} ;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<1>  The compound attribute type must be named *__<typename>_field_atts_t_*, where _<typename>_ is the name of the
variable's compound type. This prevents possible conflicts with other compound attributes.
<2>  The fields of the compound atttribute must be named *_<field>:<attribute_name>_*, using the colon ":" as a delimiter. The
CDL escapes the ":", but the backslash is not part of the name.
<3>  The variable's compound attribute must be named *__field_atts_*.

Notes:

. Only one compound attribute per compound variable can be added, which contains any number of attributes for the individual fields.
. Variables sharing the same compound type must also share the same compound attribute type, although the attribute values may be different.

=== Natural field attributes

The Compound attribute Convention allows arbitrary attributes of arbitrary data type to be added to a compound type.
Another important use case that allows significant simplification is when you would like to add the same attribute to each of the
fields in a compound type, and the data type of the attribute is the same as the field.
The canonical example is to add missing values to a compound type.

In this case, there is no need to add a separate compound type, and in practice would be confusing.
Much simpler is to add an attribute of the same compound type. This is called the *_Natural field attribute Convention_*.


Example:

-------------------------------------------------------
types:
  compound wind_vector_t {
    float eastward ;
    float northward ;
  }
dimensions:
    station = 53434 ;
variables:
    wind_vector_t wind(station) ;
       wind_vector_t wind:_FillValue = {-9999, -9999} ;
-------------------------------------------------------

. The type of the compound attribute must be the same as the type of the variable.
. The name of the compound attribute is the name of the attribute to be distributed to the members.
. Any number of attributes for a compound variable can be added using this convention.
. The type of the attribute for a field is always the same as the field itself.

=== Summary

To add attributes to fields in a compound type, use either the *Compound attribute* or the *Natural field attribute* Convention, or both.
These require no changes to the existing NetCDF / HDF5 file format or APIs, but are conventions on how libraries and applications should understand certain compound attributes.

The NetCDF Java library will follow these conventions and hide the implementation details from the user.
The NetCDF C library might in the future do the same.
